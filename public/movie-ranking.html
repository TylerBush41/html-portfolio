<h1>The Best Movies According to Tyler</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Blade Runner</h3>
<p>A movie that is becoming more relevant as time passes in dealing with what is human in our technological age.</p>
<h3>The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>The best sequel ever made, enough said.</p>
<h3>Barry Lyndon</h3>
<p>Super beautiful cinematography that is all naturally lit, that makes many of the images photographed look like beautiful mid-century paintings of its time. </p>
